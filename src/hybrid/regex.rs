/*!
A lazy DFA backed `Regex`.

This module provides [`Regex`] using lazy DFA. A `Regex` implements convenience
routines you might have come to expect, such as finding a match and iterating
over all non-overlapping matches. This `Regex` type is limited in its
capabilities to what a lazy DFA can provide. Therefore, APIs involving
capturing groups, for example, are not provided.

Internally, a `Regex` is composed of two DFAs. One is a "forward" DFA that
finds the end offset of a match, where as the other is a "reverse" DFA that
find the start offset of a match.

See the [parent module](crate::hybrid) for examples.

/// A regular expression that uses hybrid NFA/DFAs (also called "lazy DFAs")
/// for searching.
///
/// A regular expression is comprised of two lazy DFAs, a "forward" DFA and a
/// "reverse" DFA. The forward DFA is responsible for detecting the end of
/// a match while the reverse DFA is responsible for detecting the start
/// of a match. Thus, in order to find the bounds of any given match, a
/// forward search must first be run followed by a reverse search. A match
/// found by the forward DFA guarantees that the reverse DFA will also find
/// a match.
///
/// A `Regex` can also have a prefilter set via the
/// [`set_prefilter`](Regex::set_prefilter) method. By default, no prefilter is
/// enabled.
///
/// # Leftmost vs Overlapping
///
/// The search routines exposed on a `Regex` reflect two different approaches
/// to searching:
///
/// * "leftmost" means to continue matching until the underlying
///   automaton cannot advance. This reflects "standard" searching you
///   might be used to in other regex engines. e.g., This permits
///   non-greedy and greedy searching to work as you would expect.
/// * "overlapping" means to find all possible matches, even if they
///   overlap.
///
/// Generally speaking, when doing an overlapping search, you'll want to
/// build your regex lazy DFAs with [`MatchKind::All`] semantics. Using
/// [`MatchKind::LeftmostFirst`] semantics with overlapping searches is
/// likely to lead to odd behavior since `LeftmostFirst` specifically omits
/// some matches that can never be reported due to its semantics.
///
/// The following example shows the differences between how these different
/// types of searches impact looking for matches of `[a-z]+` in the
/// haystack `abc`.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{hybrid::{dfa, regex}, MatchKind, Match};
///
/// let pattern = r"[a-z]+";
/// let haystack = "abc";
///
/// // For leftmost searching, we want "leftmost-first" match kind semantics.
/// let re = regex::Builder::new()
///     .dfa(dfa::Config::new().match_kind(MatchKind::LeftmostFirst))
///     .build(pattern)?;
/// let mut cache = re.create_cache();
///
/// // "leftmost" searching supports greediness (and non-greediness)
/// let mut it = re.find_iter(&mut cache, haystack);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0, 3)), it.next());
/// assert_eq!(None, it.next());
///
/// // For overlapping, we want "all" match kind semantics.
/// let re = regex::Builder::new()
///     .dfa(dfa::Config::new().match_kind(MatchKind::All))
///     .build(pattern)?;
/// let mut cache = re.create_cache();
///
/// // In the overlapping search, we find all three possible matches
/// // starting at the beginning of the haystack.
/// let mut it = re.find_overlapping_iter(&mut cache, haystack);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0, 1)), it.next());
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0, 2)), it.next());
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0, 3)), it.next());
/// assert_eq!(None, it.next());
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Fallibility
///
/// In non-default configurations, the lazy DFAs generated in this module may
/// return an error during a search. (Currently, the only way this happens
/// is if quit bytes are added, Unicode word boundaries are heuristically
/// enabled, or if the cache is configured to "give up" on a search if it
/// has been cleared too many times. All of these are turned off by default,
/// which means a search can never fail in the default configuration.) For
/// convenience, the main search routines, like [`find`](Regex::find), will
/// panic if an error occurs. However, if you need to use DFAs which may
/// produce an error at search time, then there are fallible equivalents of
/// all search routines. For example, for `find`, its fallible analog is
/// [`try_find`](Regex::try_find). The routines prefixed with `try_` return
/// `Result<Option<Match>, MatchError>`, where as the infallible routines
/// simply return `Option<Match>`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to cause a search to terminate if it sees a
/// `\n` byte, and handle the error returned. This could be useful if, for
/// example, you wanted to prevent a user supplied pattern from matching
/// across a line boundary.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{hybrid::{dfa, regex::Regex}, MatchError};
///
/// let re = Regex::builder()
///     .dfa(dfa::Config::new().quit(b'\n', true))
///     .build(r"foo\p{any}+bar")?;
/// let mut cache = re.create_cache();
///
/// let haystack = "foo\nbar";
/// // Normally this would produce a match, since \p{any} contains '\n'.
/// // But since we instructed the automaton to enter a quit state if a
/// // '\n' is observed, this produces a match error instead.
/// let expected = MatchError::Quit { byte: 0x0A, offset: 3 };
/// let got = re.try_find(&mut cache, haystack).unwrap_err();

/// in that it permits fine grain configuration of the construction process.
/// The trade off for this is complexity, and the possibility of setting a
/// configuration that might not make sense. For example, there are three
/// different UTF-8 modes:
///
/// * [`SyntaxConfig::utf8`](crate::SyntaxConfig::utf8) controls whether the
/// pattern itself can contain sub-expressions that match invalid UTF-8.
/// * [`nfa::thompson::Config::utf8`](crate::nfa::thompson::Config::utf8)
/// controls whether the implicit unanchored prefix added to the NFA can
/// match through invalid UTF-8 or not.
/// * [`Config::utf8`] controls how the regex iterators themselves advance
/// the starting position of the next search when a match with zero length is
/// found.
///
/// Generally speaking, callers will want to either enable all of these or
/// disable all of these.
///
/// Internally, building a regex requires building two hybrid NFA/DFAs,
/// where one is responsible for finding the end of a match and the other is
/// responsible for finding the start of a match. If you only need to detect
/// whether something matched, or only the end of a match, then you should use
/// a [`dfa::Builder`] to construct a single hybrid NFA/DFA, which is cheaper
/// than building two of them.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to disable UTF-8 mode in the syntax and the regex
/// itself. This is generally what you want for matching on arbitrary bytes.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{
///     hybrid::regex::Regex, nfa::thompson, Match, SyntaxConfig
/// };
///
/// let re = Regex::builder()
///     .configure(Regex::config().utf8(false))
///     .syntax(SyntaxConfig::new().utf8(false))
///     .build(r"foo(?-u:[^b])ar.*")?;
/// let mut cache = re.create_cache();
///
/// let haystack = b"\xFEfoo\xFFarzz\xE2\x98\xFF\n";

/// let got = re.find(&mut cache, haystack);
/// assert_eq!(expected, got);
/// // Notice that `(?-u:[^b])` matches invalid UTF-8,
/// // but the subsequent `.*` does not! Disabling UTF-8
/// // on the syntax permits this.
/// //
/// // N.B. This example does not show the impact of
/// // disabling UTF-8 mode on a regex Config, since that
