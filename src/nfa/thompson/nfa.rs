/// A byte oriented Thompson non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA).
///
/// A Thompson NFA is a finite state machine that permits unconditional epsilon
/// transitions, but guarantees that there exists at most one non-epsilon
/// transition for each element in the alphabet for each state.
///
/// An NFA may be used directly for searching, for analysis or to build
/// a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
///
/// # Cheap clones
///
/// Since an NFA is a core data type in this crate that many other regex
/// engines are based on top of, it is convenient to give ownership of an NFA
/// to said regex engines. Because of this, an NFA uses reference counting
/// internally. Therefore, it is cheap to clone and it is encouraged to do so.
///
/// # Capabilities
///
/// Using an NFA for searching provides the most amount of "power" of any
/// regex engine in this crate. Namely, it supports the following:
///
/// 1. Detection of a match.
/// 2. Location of a match, including both the start and end offset, in a
/// single pass of the haystack.
/// 3. Location of matching capturing groups.
/// 4. Handles multiple patterns, including (1)-(3) when multiple patterns are
/// present.
///
/// # Capturing Groups
///
/// Groups refer to parenthesized expressions inside a regex pattern. They look
/// like this, where `exp` is an arbitrary regex:
///
/// * `(exp)` - An unnamed capturing group.
/// * `(?P<name>exp) - A named capturing group.
/// * `(?:exp)` - A non-capturing group.
/// * `(?i:exp)` - A non-capturing group that sets flags.
///
/// Only the first two forms are said to be _capturing_, which means that the
/// last position at which they match is reportable. The [`Captures`] type
/// provides convenient access to the match positions of capturing groups,
/// which includes looking up capturing groups by their name.
///
/// # Byte oriented
///
/// This NFA is byte oriented, which means that all of its transitions are
/// defined on bytes. In other words, the alphabet of an NFA consists of the
/// 256 different byte values.
///
/// While DFAs nearly demand that they be byte oriented for performance
/// reasons, an NFA could conceivably be *Unicode codepoint* oriented. Indeed,
/// a previous version of this NFA supported both byte and codepoint oriented
/// modes. A codepoint oriented mode can work because an NFA fundamentally uses
/// a sparse representation of transitions, which works well with the large
/// sparse space of Unicode codepoints.
///
/// Nevertheless, this NFA is only byte oriented. This choice is primarily
/// driven by implementation simplicity, and also in part memory usage. In
/// practice, performance between the two is roughly comparable. However,
/// building a DFA (including a hybrid DFA) really wants a byte oriented NFA.
/// So if we do have a codepoint oriented NFA, then we also need to generate
/// byte oriented NFA in order to build an hybrid NFA/DFA. Thus, by only
/// generating byte oriented NFAs, we can produce one less NFA. In other words,
/// if we made our NFA codepoint oriented, we'd need to *also* make it support
/// a byte oriented mode, which is more complicated. But a byte oriented mode
/// can support everything.
///
/// # Differences with DFAs
///
/// At the theoretical level, the precise difference between an NFA and a DFA
/// is that, in a DFA, for every state, an input symbol unambiguously refers
/// to a single transition _and_ that an input symbol is required for each
/// transition. At a practical level, this permits DFA implementations to be
/// implemented at their core with a small constant number of CPU instructions
/// for each byte of input searched. In practice, this makes them quite a bit
/// faster than NFAs _in general_. Namely, in order to execute a search for any
/// Thompson NFA, one needs to keep track of a _set_ of states, and execute
/// the possible transitions on all of those states for each input symbol.
/// Overall, this results in much more overhead. To a first approximation, one
/// can expect DFA searches to be about an order of magnitude faster.
///
/// So why use an NFA at all? The main advantage of an NFA is that it takes
/// linear time (in the size of the pattern string after repetitions have been
/// expanded) to build and linear memory usage. A DFA, on the other hand, may
/// take exponential time and/or space to build. Even in non-pathological
/// cases, DFAs often take quite a bit more memory than their NFA counterparts,
/// _especially_ if large Unicode character classes are involved. Of course,
/// an NFA also provides additional capabilities. For example, it can match
/// Unicode word boundaries on non-ASCII text and resolve the positions of
/// capturing groups.
///
/// Note that a [`hybrid::regex::Regex`](crate::hybrid::regex::Regex) strikes a
/// good balance between an NFA and a DFA. It avoids the exponential build time
/// of a DFA while maintaining its fast search time. The downside of a hybrid
/// NFA/DFA is that in some cases it can be slower at search time than the NFA.
/// (It also has less functionality than a pure NFA. It cannot handle Unicode
/// word boundaries on non-ASCII text and cannot resolve capturing groups.)
///
/// # Example
///
/// This shows how to build an NFA with the default configuration and execute a
/// search using the Pike VM.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM, Match};
///
/// let vm = PikeVM::new(r"foo[0-9]+")?;
/// let mut cache = vm.create_cache();
/// let mut caps = vm.create_captures();
///
/// let expected = Some(Match::must(0, 0..8));
/// vm.find(&mut cache, b"foo12345", &mut caps);
/// assert_eq!(expected, caps.get_match());
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Example: resolving capturing groups
///
/// This example shows how to parse some simple dates and extract the
/// components of each date via capturing groups.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{
///     nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM,
///     util::captures::Captures,
/// };
///
/// let vm = PikeVM::new(r"(?P<y>\d{4})-(?P<m>\d{2})-(?P<d>\d{2})")?;

///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())

///
/// In practice, it can help to conceptualize an `NFA` as a sequence of
/// instructions for a virtual machine. Each `State` says what to do and where
/// to go next.
///
/// Strictly speaking, the practical interpretation is the most correct one,
/// because of the [`Capture`](State::Capture) state. Namely, a `Capture`
/// state always forwards execution to another state unconditionally. Its only
/// purpose is to cause a side effect: the recording of the current input
/// position at a particular location in memory. In this sense, an `NFA`
/// has more power than a theoretical non-deterministic finite automaton.
/// (Although, strictly speaking, one could write a search implementation that
/// ignores `Capture` states and reports only the end location of a match, just
/// like the DFAs do. However, such a limited implementation does not exist in
/// this crate.)

/// For most uses of this crate, it is likely that one may never even need to
/// be aware of this type at all. The main use cases for looking at `State`s
