// This module defines some core types for dealing with accelerated DFA states.
// Briefly, a DFA state can be "accelerated" if all of its transitions except
// for a few loop back to itself. This directly implies that the only way out
// of such a state is if a byte corresponding to one of those non-loopback
// transitions is found. Such states are often found in simple repetitions in
// non-Unicode regexes. For example, consider '(?-u)[^a]+a'. We can look at its
// DFA with regex-cli:
//
//     $ regex-cli debug dfa dense '(?-u)[^a]+a' -BbC
//     dense::DFA(
//     D 000000:
//     Q 000001:
//      *000002:
//     A 000003: \x00-` => 3, a => 5, b-\xFF => 3
//      >000004: \x00-` => 3, a => 4, b-\xFF => 3
//       000005: \x00-\xFF => 2, EOF => 2
//     )
//
// In particular, state 3 is accelerated (shown via the 'A' indicator) since
// the only way to leave that state once entered is to see an 'a' byte. If
// there is a long run of non-'a' bytes, then using something like 'memchr'
// to find the next 'a' byte can be significantly faster than just using the
// standard byte-at-a-time state machine.
//
// Unfortunately, this optimization rarely applies when Unicode is enabled.
// For example, patterns like '[^a]' don't actually match any byte that isn't
// 'a', but rather, any UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode scalar value that isn't
// 'a'. This makes the state machine much more complex---far beyond a single
// state---and removes the ability to easily accelerated it. (Because if the
// machine sees a non-UTF-8 sequence, then the machine won't match through it.)
//
// In practice, we only consider accelerating states that have 3 or fewer
// non-loop transitions. At a certain point, you get diminishing returns, but
// also because that's what the memchr crate supports. The structures below
// hard-code this assumption and provide (de)serialization APIs for use inside
// a DFA. Note though that its serialization format permits any number of
// accelerated bytes.
//
// And finally, note that there is some trickery involved in making it very
// fast to not only check whether a state is accelerated at search time, but
// also to access the bytes to search for to implement the acceleration itself.
// dfa/special.rs provides more detail, but the short story is that all
// accelerated states appear contiguously in a DFA. This means we can represent
// the ID space of all accelerated DFA states with a single range. So given
// a state ID, we can determine whether it's accelerated via
//
//     min_accel_id <= id <= max_accel_id
//
// And find its corresponding accelerator with:
//
//     accels.get((id - min_accel_id) / dfa_stride)
