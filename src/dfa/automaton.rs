/// A trait describing the interface of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
///
/// The complexity of this trait probably means that it's unlikely for others
/// to implement it. The primary purpose of the trait is to provide for a way
/// of abstracting over different types of DFAs. In this crate, that means
/// dense DFAs and sparse DFAs. (Dense DFAs are fast but memory hungry, where
/// as sparse DFAs are slower but come with a smaller memory footprint. But
/// they otherwise provide exactly equivalent expressive power.) For example, a
/// [`dfa::Regex`](crate::dfa::Regex) is generic over this trait.
///
/// Normally, a DFA's execution model is very simple. You might have a single
/// start state, zero or more final or "match" states and a function that
/// transitions from one state to the next given the next byte of input.
/// Unfortunately, the interface described by this trait is significantly
/// more complicated than this. The complexity has a number of different
/// reasons, mostly motivated by performance, functionality or space savings:
///
/// * A DFA can search for multiple patterns simultaneously. This
/// means extra information is returned when a match occurs. Namely,
/// a match is not just an offset, but an offset plus a pattern ID.
/// [`Automaton::pattern_count`] returns the number of patterns compiled into
/// the DFA, [`Automaton::match_count`] returns the total number of patterns
/// that match in a particular state and [`Automaton::match_pattern`] permits
/// iterating over the patterns that match in a particular state.
/// * A DFA can have multiple start states, and the choice of which start
/// state to use depends on the content of the string being searched and
/// position of the search, as well as whether the search is an anchored
/// search for a specific pattern in the DFA. Moreover, computing the start
/// state also depends on whether you're doing a forward or a reverse search.
/// [`Automaton::start_state_forward`] and [`Automaton::start_state_reverse`]
/// are used to compute the start state for forward and reverse searches,
/// respectively.
/// * All matches are delayed by one byte to support things like `$` and `\b`
/// at the end of a pattern. Therefore, every use of a DFA is required to use
/// [`Automaton::next_eof_state`]
/// at the end of the search to compute the final transition.
/// * For optimization reasons, some states are treated specially. Every
/// state is either special or not, which can be determined via the
/// [`Automaton::is_special_state`] method. If it's special, then the state
/// must be at least one of a few possible types of states. (Note that some
/// types can overlap, for example, a match state can also be an accel state.
/// But some types can't. If a state is a dead state, then it can never be any
/// other type of state.) Those types are:
///     * A dead state. A dead state means the DFA will never enter a match
///     state. This can be queried via the [`Automaton::is_dead_state`] method.
///     * A quit state. A quit state occurs if the DFA had to stop the search
///     prematurely for some reason. This can be queried via the
///     [`Automaton::is_quit_state`] method.
///     * A match state. A match state occurs when a match is found. When a DFA
///     enters a match state, the search may stop immediately (when looking
///     for the earliest match), or it may continue to find the leftmost-first
///     match. This can be queried via the [`Automaton::is_match_state`]
///     method.
///     * A start state. A start state is where a search begins. For every
///     search, there is exactly one start state that is used, however, a
///     DFA may contain many start states. When the search is in a start
///     state, it may use a prefilter to quickly skip to candidate matches
///     without executing the DFA on every byte. This can be queried via the
///     [`Automaton::is_start_state`] method.
///     * An accel state. An accel state is a state that is accelerated.
///     That is, it is a state where _most_ of its transitions loop back to
///     itself and only a small number of transitions lead to other states.
///     This kind of state is said to be accelerated because a search routine
///     can quickly look for the bytes leading out of the state instead of
///     continuing to execute the DFA on each byte. This can be queried via the
///     [`Automaton::is_accel_state`] method. And the bytes that lead out of
///     the state can be queried via the [`Automaton::accelerator`] method.
///
/// There are a number of provided methods on this trait that implement
/// efficient searching (for forwards and backwards) with a DFA using all of
/// the above features of this trait. In particular, given the complexity of
/// all these features, implementing a search routine in this trait is not
/// straight forward. If you need to do this for specialized reasons, then
/// it's recommended to look at the source of this crate. It is intentionally
/// well commented to help with this. With that said, it is possible to
/// somewhat simplify the search routine. For example, handling accelerated
/// states is strictly optional, since it is always correct to assume that
/// `Automaton::is_accel_state` returns false. However, one complex part of
/// writing a search routine using this trait is handling the 1-byte delay of a
/// match. That is not optional.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is unsafe to implement because DFA searching may rely on the
/// correctness of the implementation for memory safety. For example, DFA
/// searching may use explicit bounds check elision, which will in turn rely
/// on the correctness of every function that returns a state ID.
///
/// When implementing this trait, one must uphold the documented correctness
/// guarantees. Otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.

    ///
    /// In practice, the quit state always corresponds to the state immediately
    /// following the dead state. (Which is not usually represented by `1`,

    /// By default, state machines created by this crate will never enter a

    /// this crate to fail, it follows that the default configuration can never
    /// produce a match error. Nevertheless, handling quit states is necessary
    /// to correctly support all configurations in this crate.
    ///
    /// The typical way in which a quit state can occur is when heuristic
    /// support for Unicode word boundaries is enabled via the
    /// [`dense::Config::unicode_word_boundary`](crate::dfa::dense::Config::unicode_word_boundary)

    /// machine enters a match state. However, if you're looking for the
    /// standard "leftmost-first" match location, then search _must_ continue
    /// until either the end of the input or until the machine enters a dead
    /// state. (Since either condition implies that no other useful work can
    /// be done.) Namely, when looking for the location of a match, then
    /// search implementations should record the most recent location in

    /// search as normal. (The search may even leave the match state.) Once
    /// the termination condition is reached, the most recently record match

    /// tag states meeting certain characteristics as accelerated. States meet

    /// number of transitions aren't self-transitions, then it follows that
    /// there are only a small number of bytes that can cause the DFA to leave
    /// that state. Thus, there is an opportunity to look for those bytes
    /// using more optimized routines rather than continuing to run through
    /// the DFA. This trick is similar to the prefilter idea described in
    /// the documentation of [`Automaton::is_start_state`] with two main
    /// differences:
    ///
    /// 1. It is more limited since acceleration only applies to single bytes.
    /// This means states are rarely accelerated when Unicode mode is enabled
    /// (which is enabled by default).
    /// 2. It can occur anywhere in the DFA, which increases optimization
    /// opportunities.
    ///
    /// Like the prefilter idea, the main downside (and a possible reason to
    /// disable it) is that it can lead to worse performance in some cases.
    /// Namely, if a state is accelerated for very common bytes, then the
    /// overhead of checking for acceleration and using the more optimized
    /// routines to look for those bytes can cause overall performance to be
    /// worse than if acceleration wasn't enabled at all.
    ///
    /// A simple example of a regex that has an accelerated state is
    /// `(?-u)[^a]+a`. Namely, the `[^a]+` sub-expression gets compiled down
    /// into a single state where all transitions except for `a` loop back to

    /// `[^a]` will match any UTF-8 encoding of any Unicode scalar value other
    /// than `a`. This more complicated expression compiles down to many DFA
    /// states and the simple acceleration optimization is no longer detected.
