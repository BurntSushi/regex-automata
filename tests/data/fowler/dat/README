Test data was taken from the Go distribution, which was in turn taken from the
testregex test suite:

  http://web.archive.org/web/20150925124103/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/testregex/testregex.html

Unfortunately, the original web site now appears dead, but the test data lives
on.

The LICENSE in this directory corresponds to the LICENSE that the data was
originally released under.

The tests themselves were modified for RE2/Go (and marked as such). A
couple were modified further by me (Andrew Gallant) and marked with 'Rust'.

I also split some of the tests in 'repetition.dat' set into their own
'repetition-expensive.dat' set to make them easier to exclude in certain tests
because they take too long (e.g., when we minimize a DFA).

After some number of years, these tests were transformed into a TOML format
using the fowler-to-toml script in the 'scripts' directory. To re-generate the
TOML files, then run the following from the root of this repository:

  ./scripts/fowler-to-toml tests/data/fowler tests/data/fowler/dat/*.dat

which brings them into a sensible structured format in which other tests can
be written.
