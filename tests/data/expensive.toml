# These represent tests that may be expensive to run on some regex engines. For
# example, tests that build a full DFA ahead of time and minimize it can take a
# horrendously long time on regexes that are large (or result in an explosion
# in the number of states). We group these tests together so that such engines
# can simply skip these tests.
